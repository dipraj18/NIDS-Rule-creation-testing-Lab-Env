# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) Lab

A complete project to develop, install, and test a fully capable Network Intrusion Detection System based on Snort. This lab is a working exercise in the application of cybersecurity concepts for the monitoring and analysis of network traffic for possible malicious activity.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project included end-to-end development of a NIDS test environment. My team installed a Snort IDS, wrote custom detection rules, coded automation and analysis scripts, and extensively documented the process. The lab is intended to be a teaching tool and a proof-of-concept for network security monitoring.

## 🚀 Features

- **Snort NIDS Setup**: An installed and tuned Snort for packet logging and intrusion detection.
- **Custom Rule Generation**: An array of custom-made Snort rules to identify all kinds of network threats and unusual activities.
- **Automation Scripts**: Python/Bash scripts to automate Snort operations, log parsing, and alert handling.
- **Testing & Verification**: A written process for testing the efficiency of the NIDS and its rules.
- **Detailed Documentation**: Well-documented guides on installation, usage, and theory about our configurations.
